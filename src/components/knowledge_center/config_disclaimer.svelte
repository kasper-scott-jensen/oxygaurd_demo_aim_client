                We take pride in offering our Dispensing Calculator as a
                user-friendly tool designed to streamline your dispensing tasks
                with ease and accuracy. However, it's important to acknowledge
                that the results provided by the calculator are estimations and
                should be treated as such. While we strive for precision,
                variations may occur based on factors beyond our control.
                Therefore, we recommend using the calculator's output as a
                helpful guide rather than absolute values, especially in
                critical applications. It's always prudent to double-check and
                validate measurements through alternative means when necessary.
